# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. Are Ruby methods accessors or mutators?

  Your answer: Ruby methods can be both mutators and accessors.

  Researched answer:There are both types of methods in ruby. Mutators set the value of an attribute of an object while an accessor is a method that gets the value of the attribute.



2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: Block is the a piece of code that is enclosed with certain logic.

  Researched answer: A block is a chunk of code that will assign a name to a block. It is always enclosed within braces and blocks are invoke a from of function with the same name as that of the block.



3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: It means it does not have to be explicitly said. The return will still happen.

  Researched answer: An implicit return is one that will return the last line automatically so it is not necessary to use a return keyword at the end of the code block.



4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: A programing model based on objects. Don't really know much besides that.

  Researched answer: A programing paradigm based on objects. This entail writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data. Objects will contain both data and functions



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: Classes are the blueprints for objects.

  Researched answer:A class is a template for objects and also can describe object behavior. An object is a member of an 'instance' of a class. Object holds state in which all properties have values.



6. STRETCH: What is Duck Typing?

  Your answer: No clue! Quack!

  Researched answer: It is a term used in dynamic languages that do not have strong typing. It means you don't need a type in order to invoke an existing method on an object. If the method is defined you can invoke it. 

  "The name comes from the phrase "If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck".""
